# Rate-My-Dorm
A community-based platform for students to share reviews, ratings, and experiences about university dorms.


# RateMyDorm

**RateMyDorm** is a community-driven platform where students can rate, review, and share their real experiences about the dorms they’ve lived in. The goal is to make it easier for future residents to find honest, helpful, and detailed information about specific dorms.

This project was inspired by the concept of **MarkMyProfessor** and by numerous Reddit posts where students expressed frustration about the lack of transparent dorm reviews. RateMyDorm aims to solve that problem by providing a centralized, easy-to-use platform dedicated entirely to student housing insights.
